    <p>
        Blue Ocean Strategy is a concept that encourages businesses to seek untapped market spaces, where competition is
        minimal or nonexistent. It promotes innovative thinking and value creation, allowing companies to escape the
        cutthroat competition of existing markets and create their own uncontested market space. By focusing on
        differentiation and low cost simultaneously, blue ocean strategy enables organizations to achieve both high
        customer value and sustainable profitability.
