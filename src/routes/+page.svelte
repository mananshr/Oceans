<h2>RED OCEAN VS BLUE OCEAN</h2><br/>

<p>
Red oceans are all the industries in existence today – the known market space, where industry boundaries are defined and companies try to outperform their rivals to grab a greater share of the existing market. Cutthroat competition turns the ocean bloody red. Hence, the term ‘red’ oceans.
Blue oceans denote all the industries not in existence today – the unknown market space, unexplored and untainted by competition. Like the ‘blue’ ocean, it is vast, deep and powerful – in terms of opportunity and profitable growth.
The chart below summarizes the distinct characteristics of competing in red oceans (<a href="red-ocean">Red Ocean Strategy</a>) versus creating a blue ocean (<a href="/blue-ocean">Blue Ocean Strategy</a>).
