	<h2><b>OCEAN VS BLUE OCEAN</b></h2>
	<p>
		Red oceans are all the industries in existence today: the known market space, where industry
		boundaries are defined and companies try to outperform their rivals to grab a greater share of
		the existing market. Cutthroat competition turns the ocean bloody red. Hence, the term ‘red’
		oceans. Blue oceans denote all the industries not in existence today: the unknown market space,
		unexplored and untainted by competition. Like the ‘blue’ ocean, it is vast, deep and powerful –
		in terms of opportunity and profitable growth. The chart below summarizes the distinct
		characteristics of competing in red oceans (<a href="red-ocean">Red Ocean Strategy</a>) versus
		creating a blue ocean (<a href="/blue-ocean">Blue Ocean Strategy</a>).
	</p>

	<p>
		🔴 Red oceans represent the fiercely competitive industries we know today, where companies fight
		tooth and nail for a larger slice of the existing market. It's a battlefield that turns the
		waters bloody red. 💉
		<br />
		💙 Blue oceans, on the other hand, symbolize uncharted territory, untainted by competition. They
		hold vast opportunities for growth and innovation, like a deep and powerful ocean waiting to be explored.

	<b>Key Distinctions between Red Ocean Strategy and Blue Ocean Strategy</b>
	<br />
	To thrive in the business landscape, red ocean strategists primarily focus on gaining competitive advantages
	by analyzing their rivals' approaches and striving to outperform them. They perceive the market as
	a finite space, where capturing a larger share entails a zero-sum game, meaning one company's gain
	is achieved at the expense of another. Their emphasis lies in dividing the existing market (red ocean)
	that is facing limited growth. This mindset leads companies to classify industries as attractive or
	unattractive, determining whether they should enter or not based on these assessments. On the other
	hand, blue ocean strategists recognize that market boundaries are merely conceptual and should not
	restrict their thinking. They perceive significant untapped demand outside the confines of existing
	market structures. The central challenge lies in creating this demand, requiring a shift in focus from
	supply to demand and from competition to generating innovative value that unlocks new demand. This
	is accomplished by simultaneously pursuing differentiation and cost efficiency. Within the framework
	of blue ocean strategy, industries themselves are not inherently attractive or unattractive since companies
	can actively modify the level of industry attractiveness through deliberate efforts. By breaking the
	traditional value-cost trade-off, the market structure undergoes transformation, and new rules are
	established. Consequently, competition in the previous framework becomes irrelevant. By expanding the
	demand side of the economy, this strategy generates new wealth. As a result, firms can engage in a
	non-zero-sum game, presenting significant potential for high returns. In summary, red ocean strategy
	focuses on outperforming competitors within existing market boundaries, while blue ocean strategy seeks
	to create new demand and redefine market boundaries to gain a competitive advantage.
